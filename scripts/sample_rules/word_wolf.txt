===================== Word Wolf Game Rules =====================

OVERVIEW
This is a word-based deduction game where most players (Citizens) receive the same secret keyword, while a few players (Wolves) receive a similar but different keyword. Players must discuss the topic without revealing their exact word, then vote to eliminate the Wolves.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
• Citizens win when at least one Wolf is voted out and eliminated.
• Wolves win when no Wolf is voted out (all Wolves survive the voting phase).

ROLES AND ABILITIES

Basic Roles:
• **Citizen**: Receives the majority keyword shared by most players. Must participate in discussion about the topic and help identify the Wolves who have different keywords.
• **Wolf**: Receives a different but related keyword from the Citizens. Must blend in during discussion and avoid being voted out.

GAME PHASES

The game follows a single-day structure:

Discussion Phase:
1. **Topic Discussion**: All players openly discuss the topic related to their keywords without revealing the exact word.
2. **Information Gathering**: Citizens try to identify inconsistencies in Wolves' knowledge, while Wolves try to blend in.
3. **Deduction**: Players analyze each other's responses to identify who might have different keywords.

Vote Phase:
1. **Elimination Vote**: Each living player privately sends the GM exactly one name of who they want to eliminate.
2. **Vote Resolution**: The player(s) with the most votes are eliminated. Ties are resolved randomly.

RESOLUTION
• Vote Phase: The player with the most votes is eliminated and removed from the game.
• Victory Check: Immediately after elimination, check if any Wolves were eliminated to determine victory.

GAME FLOW
Discussion → Vote → Elimination → Victory Check

COMMUNICATION RULES
• During Discussion: Open communication among all living players
• During Vote: Private messages to GM only
• Players may say anything about the topic EXCEPT their exact keyword
• Indirect references and descriptions are encouraged

EXAMPLE WORD PAIRS
• Apple / Pear
• Soccer / Basketball
• Cat / Dog
• Sea / River
• Sushi / Tempura

GM RESPONSIBILITIES

Keyword Management:
• Choose one word pair randomly from available pairs
• Assign the majority word to Citizens
• Assign the minority word to Wolves
• Keep word assignments secret from other players
• Never reveal any keywords publicly during the game

Game Setup:
• Assign roles based on player count:
  - 4-7 players: 1 Wolf, rest Citizens
  - 8+ players: 2 Wolves, rest Citizens

Game End:

• Reveal all keywords after victory is determined

Discussion Guidelines:
• Encourage creative descriptions of the keyword topic
• Ask players to describe characteristics, uses, or experiences
• Promote discussion that reveals knowledge without direct naming
• Examples: "I use this every day", "This is usually red or green", "You can find this outdoors"

Strategy Notes:
• Citizens should pay attention to subtle differences in knowledge
• Wolves should listen carefully to Citizens' descriptions to blend in
• Questions about specific details can help expose Wolves
• Wolves may try to ask questions to gather information without revealing ignorance
