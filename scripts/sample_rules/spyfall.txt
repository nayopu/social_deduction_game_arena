===================== Spyfall Game Rules =====================

OVERVIEW
This is a location-based deduction game where most players (Locals) know a secret location and must identify the one player (Spy) who doesn't know the location, while the Spy tries to figure out the location and blend in.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
• Locals win when they successfully vote out the Spy.
• Spy wins when they correctly guess the secret location OR when a Local is voted out instead.

ROLES AND ABILITIES

Basic Roles:
• **Local**: Knows the secret location. Must ask and answer questions to expose the Spy while avoiding giving away the location directly.
• **Spy**: Does not know the secret location. Must blend in by asking clever questions and giving vague answers, then guess the location when ready.

GAME PHASES

The game alternates between these phases until victory:

Discussion Phase:
1. **Question & Answer**: Players take turns asking each other questions about the location.
2. **Information Gathering**: Locals try to catch the Spy not knowing location details, while the Spy gathers clues.
3. **Deduction**: All players analyze responses to identify suspicious behavior.

Vote Phase:
1. **Accusation**: Each living player privately sends the GM exactly one name of who they suspect is the Spy.
2. **Vote Resolution**: The player with the most votes is revealed and their role exposed.

Spy Guess Phase (optional):
1. **Location Guess**: If the Spy is still alive after a vote, they may privately DM the GM with one location guess.
2. **Immediate Resolution**: If the guess is correct, the Spy wins instantly. If wrong, the game continues.

RESOLUTION
• Vote Phase: The player with the most votes is revealed. Ties are resolved randomly.
  - If the revealed player is the Spy → Locals win immediately
  - If the revealed player is a Local → Spy wins immediately
• Spy Guess: If the Spy's guess matches the secret location exactly → Spy wins immediately

GAME FLOW
Discussion → Vote → Reveal Result → (If Spy alive) Optional Spy Guess → Repeat until victory

COMMUNICATION RULES
• During Discussion: Open communication among all living players
• During Vote: Private messages to GM only
• Questions should be location-related but not too obvious
• Players should avoid directly stating the location name

GM RESPONSIBILITIES

Phase Management:
• Secretly choose a location at game start from the available location list
• Announce phase changes clearly
• Collect votes and spy guesses
• Reveal vote results and check victory conditions

Examples of GM Announcements:
• "GM: Discussion phase begins. Ask away!"
• "GM: Vote phase – DM me one suspect."
• "GM: [Player] is accused and revealed to be [Local/Spy]."
• "GM: Spy, DM me your location guess now."

Location Management:
• Select one location randomly from the available locations
• Inform all Local players of the location privately via DM
• Keep the location secret from the Spy
• Confirm or deny Spy's location guesses

Game Setup:
• Randomly assign one player as the Spy, all others as Locals
• Inform each player of their role privately via DM
• Share the secret location with all Local players only
• Begin with Discussion phase

Available Locations (sample):
• Airplane, Casino, Cathedral, Corporate Party, Crusader Army
• Day Spa, Embassy, Hospital, Hotel, International Space Station
• Movie Studio, Ocean Liner, Passenger Train, Pirate Ship
• Polar Station, Police Station, Restaurant, School, Service Station
• Submarine, Supermarket, Theater, University, Vacation Resort

Rule Enforcement:
• Ensure votes are submitted privately
• Accept only one location guess per Spy per round
• Prevent direct location name reveals during discussion
• Handle ties in voting by random selection
• Manage optional Spy guessing phase timing

Game End:
• Check victory conditions immediately after vote reveals
• Check victory conditions immediately after Spy guesses
• When victory conditions are met, announce "Game concluded. [TEAM] wins!" where [TEAM] is either "Locals" or "Spy"

Question Guidelines:
• Encourage creative, location-specific questions
• Questions should be answerable by someone at that location
• Avoid yes/no only questions to generate more discussion
• Examples: "What do you usually wear here?" "What's the temperature like?" "How often do you come here?"
