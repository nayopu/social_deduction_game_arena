===================== Werewolf Game Rules =====================

OVERVIEW
This is a classic Werewolf (Mafia) game where villagers try to identify and eliminate the werewolves among them, while werewolves try to survive and outnumber the villagers.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
• Villagers win when ALL Werewolves are eliminated (dead).
• Werewolves win when Werewolves ≥ Villagers among living players.

ROLES AND ABILITIES

Basic Roles:
• **Villager**: Basic town role with no special abilities. Can participate in discussions and vote to eliminate suspicious players.
• **Werewolf**: Evil role that works with other werewolves. Each night, werewolves must coordinate and choose one player to eliminate. Werewolves know each other's identities from the start.

Special Town Roles:
• **Seer**: Can investigate one player each night to learn if they are a Werewolf or not. The GM will provide this information privately.
• **Doctor**: Can protect one player each night from being killed by werewolves. Cannot protect the same player two consecutive nights.
• **Hunter**: When killed (by vote or night elimination), can immediately choose to eliminate one other player as revenge.
• **Witch**: Has two special potions that can each be used once during the game:
  - Save potion: Can save the werewolf's victim for one night
  - Kill potion: Can eliminate any player during the night
  Can only use one potion per night, and each potion can only be used once per game.

GAME PHASES

The game alternates between Day and Night phases:

Day Phase:
1. **Discussion Phase**: All living players can discuss, share information, and debate who might be a werewolf.
2. **Vote Phase**: Each living player privately sends the GM exactly one name of who they want to eliminate.

Night Phase:
• Werewolves coordinate and choose one player to eliminate (sent privately to GM).
• Special roles use their abilities (sent privately to GM):
  - Seer investigates one player
  - Doctor protects one player
  - Witch may use one potion (save or kill)

RESOLUTION
• Vote Phase: The player with the most votes is eliminated. Ties are resolved randomly.
• Night Phase: The werewolves' chosen victim is eliminated (unless protected by Doctor or saved by Witch).
• Special abilities are resolved in this order: Doctor protection → Werewolf attack → Witch save → Witch kill

GAME FLOW
Discussion → Vote → Night Actions → Repeat until victory condition is met

COMMUNICATION RULES
• During Discussion: Open communication among all living players
• During Vote: Private messages to GM only
• During Night: No discussion allowed, only private messages to GM for abilities
• Werewolves may coordinate privately at any time (DM each other)

GM RESPONSIBILITIES

Phase Management:
• Announce phase changes clearly
• Collect votes and night actions
• Announce results of votes and night eliminations

Special Role Coordination:
• Provide Seer with investigation results via private DM
• Handle Doctor protections secretly
• Manage Witch's potion usage
• Handle Hunter's revenge when triggered

  - 8+ players: 2+ Werewolves (roughly 25% of players), Seer, Doctor, Hunter, Witch, rest Villagers
• Inform each player of their role privately via DM
• Inform werewolves of their teammates privately

Game End:
• Check victory conditions after each elimination
• When victory conditions are met, announce "Game concluded. [TEAM] wins!" where [TEAM] is either "Villagers" or "Werewolves"

Rule Enforcement:
• Ensure votes are submitted privately
• Prevent discussion during night phase
• Manage special ability timing and restrictions
