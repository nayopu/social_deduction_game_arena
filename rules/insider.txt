===================== Insider Game Rules =====================

OVERVIEW
This is a cooperative word-guessing game with a hidden traitor. Players must first guess a secret word within a time limit, then identify the hidden Insider who secretly knew the word and was guiding the group.

VICTORY CONDITIONS
• Master + Commoners win when the Insider is correctly identified during the Vote phase.
• Insider wins when someone else is accused as the Insider.
• Everyone loses if the secret word is not guessed within the time limit.

ROLES AND ABILITIES

Basic Roles:
• **Master**: Moderates the question phase and answers only "Yes", "No", or "I don't know" to questions about the secret word. The Master reveals their role openly at the start.
• **Commoner**: Does not know the secret word. Must work to discover the word during the Question phase and then help identify the Insider during discussion.
• **Insider**: Secretly knows the secret word from the beginning. Must help guide the group to guess the word without being detected, then avoid being identified as the Insider.

GAME PHASES

The game follows this sequence:

Question Phase (5 minutes):
1. **Word Discovery**: Players ask the Master yes/no questions to discover the secret word.
2. **Master Responses**: The Master can only respond with "Yes", "No", or "I don't know".
3. **Insider Guidance**: The Insider subtly guides the group toward the correct word while staying hidden.

Discussion Phase (2 minutes):
• **Open Discussion**: If the word was guessed correctly, all players discuss who they suspect is the Insider.
• **Information Sharing**: Players can share their suspicions and reasoning about who the Insider might be.

Vote Phase:
• **Simultaneous Vote**: Each living player privately sends the GM exactly one name of who they suspect is the Insider.

RESOLUTION
• Question Phase: If the secret word is guessed correctly within the time limit, proceed to Discussion phase. If not, everyone loses.
• Vote Phase: The player with the most votes is accused as the Insider. Ties are resolved randomly.
• Victory Check: If the accused player is the Insider, Master + Commoners win. If not, the Insider wins.

GAME FLOW
Question Phase → (If word guessed) Discussion Phase → Vote Phase → Victory Check
